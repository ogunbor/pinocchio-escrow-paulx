This is the infamous Paulx Escrow built with Pinocchio. This facilitates token swaps using two vaults rather than one. Bob deposits Token X, and Alice deposits Token Y into their respective vaults. Once both deposits are complete, the contract automatically transfers Token X to Alice and Token Y to Bob, ensuring a trustless and atomic exchange
